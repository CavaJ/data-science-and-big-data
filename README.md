Source code for the locality sensitive hashing, document deduplication and music recommender. 

- Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm uses cosine distance to perform an efficient nearest neighbor search for high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.
- Document Deduplication example utilizes Rabin fingerprints, q-shingles, irreducable polynomial, Jaccard similarity and a hash function.
- Music Recommender is based on Hadoop Cascading and employs the lastfm dataset.

More will be added in the future.
